        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
                <li>
                        Rinse the rice in a colander and transfer to a small
                        saucepan. Add water and salt; bring to a boil.
                        <ul>
                                <li>1 cup basmati rice</li>
                                <li>2 cups water</li>
                                <li><sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>4</sub> tsp salt
                                  </li>
                        </ul>
                </li>
                <li>
                        Wash and dry the fresh produce.
                        <ul>
                                <li>1 medium head napa cabbage</li>
                                <li>2 medium carrots</li>
                        </ul>
                </li>
                <li>
                        Once the water is boiling, reduce the heat to low, stir,
                        and cover. Cook until liquid is absorbed, 10 to 15
                        minutes. Remove from the heat and let it stand, covered,
                        for 5 minutes.
                </li>
                <li>
                        Trim off and discard the root end of the cabbage;
                        quarter the cabbage lengthwise, then cut crosswise into
                        1-inch pieces and transfer to a large bowl.
                </li>
                <li>
                        Peel and small dice the onion.
                        <ul>
                                <li>1 medium yellow onion</li>
                        </ul>
                </li>
                <li>
                        Heat a skillet over medium-high heat.
                </li>
                <li>
                        Peel and mince the garlic.
                        <ul>
                                <li>4 cloves garlic</li>
                        </ul>
                </li>
                <li>
                        Add the beef, onion, and garlic to the skillet; cook,
                        breaking apart the meat into smaller pieces, until the
                        beef is browned and the onion is tender, 3 to 5 minutes.
                        <ul>
                                <li>1<sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>2</sub> lbs lean
                                  ground beef</li>
                        </ul>
                </li>
                <li>
                        Add the diced tomatoes and cabbage and season with salt
                        and pepper. If the cabbage doesn't fit, cook it down and
                        add the rest after. Reduce heat to medium and cover.
                        Cook until the cabbage is softened, 10 to 15 minutes.
                        <ul>

                                <li>1 tsp salt</li>

                        </ul>
                </li>
                <li>
                        Trim the stem ends and peel the carrots; discard the
                        trimmings and coarsely grate the carrots.
                </li>
                <li>
                        Once the cabbage is softened, add the grated carrots and
                        rice to the skillet; stir to combine. Cook until the
                        carrots are softened, 1 to 2 minutes.
                </li>
                <li>
